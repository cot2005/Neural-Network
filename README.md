# Neural-Network
Basic Neural Network functions to test and build a neural network for a binary output with the NeuralNet R package.

Functions that can be used to optimize neural network configurations through cross validation. These functions are written for a binary output but can also be modified for continuous data. This current version only includes min-max scaling option. Once NN.optimize.Binary has been used to find a layer configuration that has the best performance, NN.binary.stkBuildv1.0 can be used to build and test the final model.
